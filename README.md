# angular-service

Hi, <br/>

This is a simple Angular POC created by Abhishek Choubey. <br/>

In this POC I tried to demonstrate Services concepts In Angular.  <br/>

<b> Important Notes <b/> <br/>
After Angular 6 providedIn concept was introduced.  <br/>
Service should always be singleton <br/>
Tree Shakeable Providers concept introduced in Angular 6 to remove unuseable services from build <br/>
@Injectable is used for nesting service concept <br/>

Software Used <br/>
node --version = v14.20.0 <br/>
npm --version = 6.14.17 <br/>
ng version <br/>
Angular CLI: 14.0.0 <br/>
